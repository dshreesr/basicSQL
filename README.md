# About the Project :
In this project I have done basic analysis of dummy instagram application data using MySQL.
The database has following tables :
1. Users - details of the users like userid,name,account created date and time.
2. likes - details of likes each photo has on the application - photo liked, who has liked it.
3. photos - details of the photo posted like photo_id, user_id who posted it, when it was posted.
4. tags - hashtags added to each photo.
